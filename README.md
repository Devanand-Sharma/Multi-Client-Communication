# Server-MultiClient
This project enables a user to enable a server which can communicate with multiple clients. 

To test, edit the port number in the server code to your preferred port number. Run the server code on your computer.

In the client code, set the IP address as your local host IP (127.0.0.1), along with assigning the designated port number for your server. 

You can now run the server code in a terminal, and open multiple clients via their own terminal instances, and communicate with the server. 

This code structures the barebones needed for tasks such as at home media servers, file servers, and more.
